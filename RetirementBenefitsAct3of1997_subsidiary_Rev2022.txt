APPLICATION 
FOR 
EXEMPTION 


In terms of Regulation 31(1)(C)(iii) of the Retirement Benefits 
(Occupational Retirement Benefits Schemes) Regulations 


Name of the scheme 


I have Scrutinised 


(a) 
the rules and the method of operation of the scheme since the issue of the previous 
certificate 
(b) a sample explanatory booklet given to members, and 
(c) a sample of an individual member's benefit statement 
In respect of the period smce the issue of the previous certificate

No. 3 of 1997 
[Rev. 
2022] 


Retirement Benefits 


[Subsidiary] 


(a) 
The method used to allocate investment returns to individual account has been as follows 
(b) 
Expenses (including the premiums paid for the msurance of death and disability risks) 
have been handled as follows 
(c) Members of the scheme were/were not (delete whichever is not applicable) 
Provided with projections of their expected ultimate benefits If they were provided with 
such projections, the basis of such projections was/was not approved by an actuary (delete 
whichever is not applicable) 


(d) All risk benefits fallmg due were fully covered by insurance or reinsurance 
(e) 
All 
pension 
payments 
fallmg 
due 
were 
fully 
recovered 
by 
life 
office 
annuities 
(f) The assets of the fund at all time adequately matched its liabilities 
Having taken account of the manner in which expenses, including the premiums paid for 
the insurance of death and disability risks investment returns and any surpluses or stains 
will be distributed between members in future, I am satisfied that 


(i) all benefits, other than those fully secured by an insurer are limited in value 
to the contributions, net of expenses including the premiums paid for the 
msurance of death and disability risks, accumulated with investments return 
as determine by the person managing the business of the scheme, 
(ii) all periodic retirement benefit payments will be fully secured by the purchase 
of 
annuities 
from 
an 
insurer, 
(iii) any surplus or strains will be distributed amongst members such that the value 
of the accmed liabilities of the scheme will not exceed the market value of 
the assets of the scheme Such method of distribution of surpluses or strains 
is equitable between classes of member and by duration of membership, is 
consistent with the nature of the surpluses or strains and will not conflict with 
the 
reasonable 
benefit 
expectations 
of 
member. 
In my opinion continued exemption in terms of regulation 34(7) is warranted 


The certificate should state the actuary s qualification and capacity in which he has 
signed the report 


Notes 


(1) Where the actuary is unable to made the statements above without qualification, 
but feels that the refusal of exemption would be unduly harsh, the actuary must qualify the 
statement above where appropriate and give reasons why exemption should still be granted 
(2) The actuary may add any other matters relevant to the principles upon which 
exemption is sought
